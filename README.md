# Eventz

**Still in development** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## This is an application developed for people who love to go to events.

### üí° About the project 

This is an application that I designed and developed thinking about my problem when I want to search for some event close to me, usually, we have to access a bunch of websites to find a good event, so thinking about this I decided to develop this application where we can have all the events close to us doesn't matter where we are, and add to your calendar only with two clicks.

The project was developed entirely programmatically and using MVC Design Pattern

### ‚öíÔ∏è Tools used by me to design and develop this application:

- Xcode 
- Swift
- Figma
- EventKit
